# Potential-Customer-Prediction-project
Project Introduction:
In the "Potential Customer Prediction" project, our goal is to leverage machine learning algorithms to forecast potential customer conversion probabilities. This binary classification project focuses on identifying patterns within diverse datasets to optimize marketing strategies and enhance overall sales performance.

*Steps Involved:

*Data Collection: Gathered and curated extensive datasets, incorporating historical customer data, surveys, and web analytics.

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comprehensive EDA to extract actionable insights, guiding marketing and sales strategy formulation.

*Model Development: Employed machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors to develop and fine-tune predictive models.

*Hypothesis Testing: Utilized hypothesis testing to validate assumptions, assess feature significance, and refine models iteratively.

*SMOTENC Implementation: Addressed imbalanced data using the 'SMOTENC' technique to enhance model sensitivity to potential customer patterns.

*Model Integration: Collaborated cross-functionally to seamlessly integrate models into business operations, optimizing resource allocation and improving sales outcomes.
